            With an ever-increasing amount of (meta)genomic data being deposited in sequence databases, (meta)genome mining for natural product biosynthetic pathways occupies a critical role in the discovery of novel pharmaceutical drugs, crop protection agents and biomaterials. The genes that encode these pathways are often organised into biosynthetic gene clusters ({BGCs}). In 2015, we defined the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster ({MIBiG}): a standardised data format that describes the minimally required information to uniquely characterise a {BGC}. We simultaneously constructed an accompanying online database of {BGCs}, which has since been widely used by the community as a reference dataset for {BGCs} and was expanded to 2021 entries in 2019 ({MIBiG} 2.0). Here, we describe {MIBiG} 3.0, a database update comprising large-scale validation and re-annotation of existing entries and 661 new entries. Particular attention was paid to the annotation of compound structures and biological activities, as well as protein domain selectivities. Together, these new features keep the database up-to-date, and will provide new opportunities for the scientific community to use its freely available data, e.g. for the training of new machine learning models to predict sequence-structure-function relationships for diverse natural products. {MIBiG} 3.0 is accessible online at https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/.},

            Microorganisms produce natural products that are frequently used in the development of antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer drugs, pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides. In recent years, genome mining has evolved into a prominent method to access this potential. {antiSMASH} is one of the most popular tools for this task. Here, we present version 3 of the {antiSMASH} database, providing a means to access and query precomputed {antiSMASH}-5.2-detected biosynthetic gene clusters from representative, publicly available, high-quality microbial genomes via an interactive graphical user interface. In version 3, the database contains 147 517 high quality {BGC} regions from 388 archaeal, 25 236 bacterial and 177 fungal genomes and is available at https://antismash-db.secondarymetabolites.org/.},

            Within the natural products field there is an increasing emphasis on the study of compounds from microbial sources. This has been fuelled by interest in the central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full {RESTful} application programming interface ({API}), a new website framework, and an expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552. In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from both {NP} Classifier and {ClassyFire}. We have also performed manual curation to review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have integrated data from external resources, including {CyanoMetDB}. Finally, we have improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a dashboard for taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via the new interactive website at https://www.npatlas.org.},

	abstract = {Natural products (bio)synthesised by microbes are an important component of the pharmacopeia with a vast array of biomedical applications, in addition to their key role in many ecological interactions. One approach for the discovery of these metabolites is the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters ({BGCs}), genomic units which encode the molecular machinery required for producing the natural product. Genome mining has revolutionised the discovery of {BGCs}, yet metagenomic assemblies represent a largely untapped source of natural products. The imbalanced distribution of {BGC} classes in existing databases restricts the generalisation of detection patterns and limits the ability of mining methods to recognise a broader spectrum of {BGCs}. This problem is further intensified in metagenomic datasets, where {BGC} genes may be split across multiple contigs. This work presents {SanntiS}, a new machine learning-based approach for identifying {BGCs}. {SanntiS} achieved high precision and recall in both genomic and metagenomic datasets, effectively capturing a broad range of {BGCs}. Application of {SanntiS} to metagenomic assemblies found in {MGnify} led to a resource containing 1.1 million {BGC} predictions with associated contextual data from diverse biomes. Additionally, experimental validation of a previously undescribed {BGC}, detected solely by {SanntiS}, further demonstrates the potential of this approach in uncovering novel bioactive compounds. The study illustrates the significance of metagenomic datasets in comprehensively understanding the diversity and distribution of {BGCs} in microbial communities.},

The \&gt;200,000 microbial genomes now publicly available hold information on abundant novel chemistry. One way to navigate this vast genomic diversity is through comparative analysis of homologous {BGCs}, which allows identification of cross-species patterns that can be matched to the presence of metabolites or biological activities. However, current tools are hindered by a bottleneck caused by the expensive network-based approach used to group these {BGCs} into gene cluster families ({GCFs}).Here, we introduce {BiG}-{SLiCE}, a tool designed to cluster massive numbers of {BGCs}. By representing them in Euclidean space, {BiG}-{SLiCE} can group {BGCs} into {GCFs} in a non-pairwise, near-linear fashion. We used {BiG}-{SLiCE} to analyze 1,225,071 {BGCs} collected from 209,206 publicly available microbial genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes within 10 days on a typical 36-core {CPU} server. We demonstrate the utility of such analyses by reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity across taxonomy to identify uncharted biosynthetic potential. {BiG}-{SLiCE} also provides a “query mode” that can efficiently place newly sequenced {BGCs} into previously computed {GCFs}, plus a powerful output visualization engine that facilitates user-friendly data exploration.{BiG}-{SLiCE} opens up new possibilities to accelerate natural product discovery and offers a first step towards constructing a global and searchable interconnected network of {BGCs}. As more genomes are sequenced from understudied taxa, more information can be mined to highlight their potentially novel chemistry. {BiG}-{SLiCE} is available via https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice.},

In addition to underexplored organismal groups1, this diversity encompasses a rich discovery potential for ecologically and biotechnologically relevant enzymes and biochemical compounds2,3. However, studying this diversity to identify genomic pathways for the synthesis of such compounds4 and assigning them to their respective hosts remains challenging. The biosynthetic potential of microorganisms in the open ocean remains largely uncharted owing to limitations in the analysis of genome-resolved data at the global scale. Here we investigated the diversity and novelty of biosynthetic gene clusters in the ocean by integrating around 10,000 microbial genomes from cultivated and single cells with more than 25,000 newly reconstructed draft genomes from more than 1,000 seawater samples. These efforts revealed approximately 40,000 putative mostly new biosynthetic gene clusters, several of which were found in previously unsuspected phylogenetic groups. Among these groups, we identified a lineage rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (‘Candidatus Eudoremicrobiaceae’) that belongs to an uncultivated bacterial phylum and includes some of the most biosynthetically diverse microorganisms in this environment. From these, we characterized the phospeptin and pythonamide pathways, revealing cases of unusual bioactive compound structure and enzymology, respectively. Together, this research demonstrates how microbiomics-driven strategies can enable the investigation of previously undescribed enzymes and natural products in underexplored microbial groups and environments.},

	abstract = {This review is an updated and expanded version of the five prior reviews that were published in this journal in 1997, 2003, 2007, 2012, and 2016. For all approved therapeutic agents, the time frame has been extended to cover the almost 39 years from the first of January 1981 to the 30th of September 2019 for all diseases worldwide and from ∼1946 (earliest so far identified) to the 30th of September 2019 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. As in earlier reviews, only the first approval of any drug is counted, irrespective of how many “biosimilars” or added approvals were subsequently identified. As in the 2012 and 2016 reviews, we have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a “natural product mimic”, or “{NM}”, to join the original primary divisions, and the designation “natural product botanical”, or “{NB}”, to cover those botanical “defined mixtures” now recognized as drug entities by the {FDA} (and similar organizations). From the data presented in this review, the utilization of natural products and/or synthetic variations using their novel structures, in order to discover and develop the final drug entity, is still alive and well. For example, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from 1946 to 1980, of the 75 small molecules, 40, or 53.3\%, are N or {ND}. In the 1981 to date time frame the equivalent figures for the N* compounds of the 185 small molecules are 62, or 33.5\%, though to these can be added the 58 S* and S*/{NMs}, bringing the figure to 64.9\%. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked with, as expected from prior information, the anti-infective area being dependent on natural products and their structures, though as can be seen in the review there are still disease areas (shown in Table 2) for which there are no drugs derived from natural products. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have been used very successfully in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are still able to identify only two de novo combinatorial compounds (one of which is a little speculative) approved as drugs in this 39-year time frame, though there is also one drug that was developed using the “fragment-binding methodology” and approved in 2012. We have also added a discussion of candidate drug entities currently in clinical trials as “warheads” and some very interesting preliminary reports on sources of novel antibiotics from Nature due to the absolute requirement for new agents to combat plasmid-borne resistance genes now in the general populace. We continue to draw the attention of readers to the recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the “host from whence it was isolated”; thus we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.},

Comparative analyses with previously available finished and draft genomes reveal a 10.5\% increase in novel protein families as a function of phylogenetic diversity. The {GEBA} genomes recruit 25 million previously unassigned metagenomic proteins from 4,650 samples, improving their phylogenetic and functional interpretation. We identify numerous biosynthetic clusters and experimentally validate a divergent phenazine cluster with potential new chemical structure and antimicrobial activity. This Resource is the largest single release of reference genomes to date. Bacterial and archaeal isolate sequence space is still far from saturated, and future endeavors in this direction will continue to be a valuable resource for scientific discovery.},

Surface immobilisation of hydrophilic and chemically stable inorganic metal oxides ({TiO}2, {ZrO}2, etc) has been developed to improve hydrophilicity of the {PTFE} {UFMs}, though they still suffer from expensive and repeating regenerations once fouled. To address such issues, we strive to firmly immobilize g-C3N4 modified {TiO}2 (g-C3N4/{TiO}2, hereafter {CNTO}) onto {PTFE} {UFM} via a facile plasma-enhanced surface graft technique using polyacrylic acid ({PAA}) as a bridging agent. As reported here, the obtained {CNTO}/{PAA}/{PTFE} {UFM} shows much smaller surface water contact angle ({WCA}) of 62.3° than that of bare {PTFE} {UFM}(115.8°), leading to enhanced water flux of 830 L m−2 h-1 in the initial ultrafiltration of modelled waste-water containing methylene blue ({MB}). The {CNTO}/{PAA}/{PTFE} {UFM} is highly resistant to fouling in the prolonged filtration of 1000 mg/L bovine serum albumin ({BSA}) solution, while the fouled {CNTO}/{PAA}/{PTFE} {UFM} is able to regenerate rapidly under either {UV} or visible-light irradiation. The enhanced performance of the novel {CNTO}/{PAA}/{PTFE} {UFM} is reasonably attributed to its high wettability and robust photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/{TiO}2 coating that follows different self-cleaning mechanisms under {UV} and visible light irradiations.},

	abstract = {We characterized the fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) from pyrene (donor) to perylene (acceptor) for nucleic acid assays under homogeneous solution conditions. We used the hybridization between a target 32 mer and its complementary two sequential 16 mer deoxyribonucleotides whose neighboring terminals were each respectively labeled with a pyrene and a perylene residue. A transfer efficiency of approximately 100\% was attained upon the hybridization when observing perylene fluorescence at 459 nm with 347-nm excitation of a pyrene absorption peak. The Förster distance between two dye residues was 22.3 A (the orientation factor of 2/3). We could change the distance between the residues by inserting various numbers of nucleotides into the center of the target, thus creating a gap between the dye residues on a hybrid. Assuming that the number of inserted nucleo-tides is proportional to the distance between the dye residues, the energy transfer efficiency versus number of inserted nucleotides strictly obeyed the Förster theory. The mean inter-nucleotide distance of the single-stranded portion was estimated to be 2.1 A. Comparison between the fluorescent properties of a pyrene-perylene pair with those of a widely used fluorescein-rhodamine pair showed that the pyrene-perylene {FRET} is suitable for hybridization assays.},

The curve fitting method combined with the Fourier self-deconvolution technique allowed us to explore details of the secondary structure and conformation changes in defatted {BSA}. Particularly striking in the {FT}-{IR} spectra was an observation of the formation of an irreversible intermolecular β-sheet of {BSA} on heating above 70 °C. A band at 1630 cm-1 in the spectra was assigned to short-segment chains connecting α-helical segments. The transition temperature for the short-segment chains connecting α-helical segments is lower by 17−18 °C, when compared to those of the α-helix, turn, and intermolecular β-sheet structures of {BSA}, suggesting that the α-helix and turn structures of {BSA} are cooperatively denatured on heating. Moreover, the results give an important feature in heat-induced denaturation of {BSA} that the conformation changes occur twice around both 57 and 75 °C. The appearance of two peaks is interpreted by the collapse of the N-terminal {BSA} domain due to the crevice in the vicinity between domains I and {II} at low-temperature transition and by the change in cooperative unit composed of the other two {BSA} domains at high-temperature transition.},

Here, we apply high-resolution molecular analyses on sedimentary ancient {DNA} to reconstruct the history of cyanobacteria throughout the Holocene in a lake in north-eastern Germany. We find a substantial increase in cyanobacteria abundance coinciding with deforestation during the early Bronze Age around 4000 years ago, suggesting increased nutrient supply to the lake by local communities settling on the lakeshore. The next substantial human-driven increase in cyanobacteria abundance occurred only about a century ago due to intensified agricultural fertilisation which caused the dominance of potentially toxic taxa (e.g., Aphanizomenon). Our study provides evidence that humans began to locally impact lake ecology much earlier than previously assumed. Consequently, managing aquatic systems today requires awareness of the legacy of human influence dating back potentially several millennia.},

In order to evaluate this risk, it is of interest to acquire a better knowledge of the composition of the microbial communities found in this understudied environment. Here, we present a metagenomic analysis of 12 soil samples from Russian Arctic and subarctic pristine areas: Chukotka, Yakutia and Kamchatka, including nine permafrost samples collected at various depths. These large datasets (9.2 × 1011 total bp) were assembled (525 313 contigs \&gt; 5 kb), their encoded protein contents predicted, and then used to perform taxonomical assignments of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, as well as {DNA} viruses. The various samples exhibited variable {DNA} contents and highly diverse taxonomic profiles showing no obvious relationship with their locations, depths or deposit ages. Bacteria represented the largely dominant {DNA} fraction (95\%) in all samples, followed by archaea (3.2\%), surprisingly little eukaryotes (0.5\%), and viruses (0.4\%). Although no common taxonomic pattern was identified, the samples shared unexpected high frequencies of β-lactamase genes, almost 0.9 copy/bacterial genome. In addition to known environmental threats, the particularly intense warming of the Arctic might thus enhance the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistances, today's major challenge in public health. β-Lactamases were also observed at high frequency in other types of soils, suggesting their general role in the regulation of bacterial populations.},

	abstract = {Although the first ancient {DNA} molecules were extracted more than three decades ago, the first ancient nuclear genomes could only be characterized after high-throughput sequencing was invented. Genome-scale data have now been gathered from thousands of ancient archaeological specimens, and the number of ancient biological tissues amenable to genome sequencing is growing steadily. Ancient {DNA} fragments are typically ultrashort molecules and carry extensive amounts of chemical damage accumulated after death. Their extraction, manipulation and authentication require specific experimental wet-laboratory and dry-laboratory procedures before patterns of genetic variation from past individuals, populations and species can be interpreted. Ancient {DNA} data help to address an entire array of questions in anthropology, evolutionary biology and the environmental and archaeological sciences. The data have revealed a considerably more dynamic past than previously appreciated and have revolutionized our understanding of many major prehistoric and historic events. This Primer provides an overview of concepts and state-of-the-art methods underlying ancient {DNA} analysis and illustrates the diversity of resulting applications.
